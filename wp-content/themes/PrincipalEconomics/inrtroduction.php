                                <p>In this report we assess the extent to which the Resource Management Act (RMA) and other environmental regulations have contributed to house price inflation in Aotearoa. To do this, we review the factors of housing price growth (HPG) in New Zealand and provide a simple description of the available data and existing research on the topic. In this chapter, we briefly explain our methodology for the literature review and then present the relevant descriptive statistics for the factors of HPG. Then we have two separate chapters on factors of supply and factors of demand. In each of the chapters we provide different sections on the literature review of the topics of interest. In the last section, we discuss the limitations of the literature and potential future studies required for improving our understanding of the factors of HPG in New Zealand. For the analyses of the factors of HPG, given this project’s short timeframe, we have set limits on the scope of the data analysis. Where information is available, we use the existing work and provide a description of the findings.</p>

                                    <p>For a systematic review of the literature, we followed a four-step process for finding relevant studies:</p>
                                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
                                        <li><p>Define the topic of interest: For a correct understanding of the drivers of house price growth, we need to have a review of the impact of environmental regulations and all other relevant factors.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Undertake a systematic review of the relevant research literature to the topics of interest. Each factor of demand and supply will be defined as a topic of interest and looked for in the literature in a separate section of our report.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Use independent research search engines and databases, e.g. Econlit, SAGE, SCOPUS, Proquest, Ebsco, Google Scholar, and a general google search for finding the grey literature</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Contact relevant New Zealand organisations and authors of relevant research topics to learn about other (unpublished) available sources</p></li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>After finding the relevant studies, we assess each chosen topic against the IPCC’s uncertainty framework (IPCC, 2010). To do this, we highlight the methodological quality of the studies (research design).
                                        We prioritise using the highest quality well implemented research designs in our review.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The output of IPCC’s uncertainty framework is illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

                                            <p>Based on this framework, we rank the agreement, evidence and confidence we have with the results from the literature in a diagram at the beginning of each section. We clarify the hypothesis that the diagram is referring to. ‘Agreement’ shows the level of compliance across the studies on the stated hypothesis. ‘Evidence’ shows the availability and quality of the data and methodology available in the literature on the specific hypothesis. ‘Confidence’ is the combination of agreement, evidence and our evaluation of the credibility of the findings from the literature. The scoring scale used has the following characteristics:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><p>the scale has a range from one to three,</p></li>

                                    <p>HPG has been discussed amongst politicians and academics extensively. Different solutions to housing crises have been proposed over the last decades. The solutions target factors of demand and supply and include increases in deposit ratios, a foreign buyer ban, decreases in zoning regulation, capital gains tax, RM reform amongst the others. The first step to finding a solution is to define the HPG issue correctly and identify its sources. Because of the inter-related impact of the supply and demand factors, one cannot look just at housing supply, or housing demand to judge its impact on housing outcomes. All these aspects must be considered together.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
                                    <p>This section provides a description of the HPG and the related factors using a range of publicly available data. The purpose of this section is to provide some background and motivate the topics of the studies that we review in the next sections. We provide the findings from our review and any causal inference about the impact of different factors of HPG in the next sections. We intend to provide a description of the HPG over the last fifty years for the 1971-2021 period. When data is not available, we illustrate and describe the data for the longest timeframe available.</p>

                                        <p>As will be discussed in the literature review sections, one commonly cited reason for HPG are the low interest rates that have ensued since 1991, enabling greater serviceability of mortgages and higher borrowing potential. As shown in Figure 4, over the 1971-2021 period, mortgage floating rates have been extremely volatile with a minimum of 4.51 percent in December 2020 and a maximum of 20.5 percent in June 1987.</p>

                                        <p>Figure 5 illustrates the changes in real house prices for New Zealand and other countries. Over the 1971-2021 period, the HPG in New Zealand has been the second highest, with slightly slower growth than the UK. The response of different housing markets to crises has been different. For example, the GFC led to significant price decreases in the US and the UK, with smaller increases in New Zealand and Germany, and raised house prices in Australia and Canada. This partly reflects the impact of local monetary policy and the availability of finance to appropriately respond to a short-term economic crisis. During the Covid-19 pandemic, most countries have experienced increases in house prices, partly due to lower mortgage rates. During this period, <strong>New Zealand has the highest HPG amongst the listed countries</strong>, which may indicate the impact of lower mortgage rates combined with the shortage of housing evident from the already increasing house price trend before the Covid-19 period.</p>

The relatively high HPG compared to growth in cost of renting may be an indicator for high speculation incentives.

Accordingly, the median price to income multiplier in Auckland has increased from 7.5 in 2000 to 12 in 2020. While indicators tend to be blunt tools for describing affordability, an increase in the ratio of median house price to income from 6.02 to 9.74 for New Zealand is a significant sign of increasing housing affordability issues.
