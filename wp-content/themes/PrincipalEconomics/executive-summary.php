                                    <h4>Despite being one of the national priorities, New Zealand’s HPG has not been discussed and analysed thoroughly and the available literature does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the drivers of HPG<a href="https://6229.freelancedeveloper.site/executive-summary#despite-being-one-of-the-national-priorities-new-zealands-hpg-has-not-been-discussed-and-analysed-thoroughly-and-the-available-literature-does-not-provide-a-comprehensive-understanding-of-the-drivers-of-hpg" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
                                    <p>With an annual growth of 3.1 percent over inflation, the HPG has led to significantly lower housing affordability with a widening gap between low- and high-income groups. This has led to high economic costs to the New Zealand economy, with a minimum $1.1 billion annual cost through lower labour productivity levels.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The available literature provides information about the impact of supply and demand factors on house prices. This provides us with an understanding of the relative cost of the factors of supply and demand capitalised into the house prices. However, the impact of the factors on house price <u>growth</u>, and the relative contribution of each of these factors on HPG is not clear. Most of the available literature provides an understanding of the impact of each factor affecting house prices in isolation. While there has been extensive analysis of some factors, such as the impact of regulation on housing supply, other drivers of HPG have been neglected. Table 1 shows our evaluation of the level of agreement, the strength of evidence and the overall confidence with the impact of each factor of supply and demand on HPG. We discuss this further in the following paragraphs.</p>

                                        <p>Despite the extensive focus of the literature on the costs imposed by some factors, the studies do not provide enough information to inform policy development. For example, the extensive literature on the costs imposed from regulation, does not provide robust evidence of the role of the Resource Management Act (RMA) versus the role of other planning regulation. The RMA provides a framework for sustainable management of natural and physical resources. While the RMA does not explicitly require any supply side regulation, it provides a regulatory framework for the implementation of the planning regulations. The planning regulations cite the RMA as the driver of the zoning regulations. The linkages between the RMA and zoning regulations are untested.</p>

                                        <p>Some indicators of affordability, such as price to income and price to rent ratios, are overly simplified and their implications for the analysis of affordability (and HPG) in New Zealand is not clear. There are advantages in using simplified indicators of HPG and its determinant factors – particularly, for ease of understanding and high-level policy discussions. However, we observe a trend in using overly simplified indicators for policy advice, without accounting for the underlying complexities. This can lead to unintended policy outcomes.</p>

                                        <p>Our review suggests that the factors of demand, such as lower interest rates and increased immigration, have been some of the reasons for the significant HPG over the last twenty years. The number of studies that
                                            have isolated the factors of housing demand in New Zealand is smaller than the number of studies of the factors of supply. This is partly because the factors of housing demand have wider economic impacts
                                            beyond the housing market and therefore it is difficult to identity policy instruments that only affect house prices. For example, a change in interest rate affects all other economic activities, as well
                                            as the housing market.</p>

                                        <p>Based on the literature, a lower interest rate increases a household’s ability to pay for a house. If housing supply is responsive to the higher ability of a household to pay, then the increase in supply
                                            avoids significant increases in house prices. But since housing supply has not been responsive to households’ higher mortgage serviceability levels over the last decade, the lower interest rates have led to higher house prices. The impact of monetary policy highly depends on the other (supply) factors. While the long-term impact of monetary policy depends on the speed at which supply can respond to demand side
                                            factors, in the short- term monetary policy will likely always have a direct impact on house prices because supply lags behind demand, and it takes time to build more homes. The evidence-based literature on

For a population of 5 million, a change from 3 PPH to 2.6 PPH is associated with a need for more than 250,000 additional dwellings.
